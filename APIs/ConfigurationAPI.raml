    content: |
      The Configuration API is exposed by each NMOS Device in a system that supports the AMWA NMOS Device Configuration Specification. The API is used to access the NMOS Device's Device Model which is defined according to the [AMWA NMOS Control Architecture](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-01/) and [AMWA NMOS Control Framework](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-02/).
  - title: 'Further Documentation'

      Further normative documentation covering the behaviour of this API is contained in the [docs](../docs) folder of this repository.
